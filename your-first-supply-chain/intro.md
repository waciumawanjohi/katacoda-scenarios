# Your First Supply Chain

## Description

In this scenario you will use a set of kubernetes resources to take your code
and turn it into a live deployment in your cluster. Having done this manually,
you will then use Cartographer to automate this process, to encode that path to
production as a supply chain.

## Learning Objective

- How to use Cartographer to define a reusable path to production
- How to template a kubernetes resource with Cartographer
- How to connect templates and have one consume the output of the other

## Prerequisite Skills

This tutorial is for engineers familiar with kubernetes. We'll create and
observe a number of objects.

## Table of Contents

This is the first of a set of scenarios to learn how to create a product
platform using Cartographer.
