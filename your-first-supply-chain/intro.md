# Your First Supply Chain

## Description

In this scenario you will use a set of kubernetes resources to take your code and turn it into a live deployment in your cluster.
Having done this manually, you will then use Cartographer to automate this process, to encode that path to production in a supply chain.
You will see how this Supply Chain can be used to create an application platform that you define.

## Learning Objective

- How to use Cartographer to define a reusable path to production
- How to template a kubernetes resource with Cartographer
- How to connect templates and have one consume the output of the other

## Prerequisite Skills

This tutorial is for engineers familiar with kubernetes. We will use 3 kubernetes resources

- fluxcd GitRepositories
- kpack Images
- Deployments
